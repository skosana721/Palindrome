# Pilindrome

This is a palindrome function which checks if a word or a sentence is spelled the same way both forward or backward while ignoring punctuation, case,  and spacing and if the word or sentence is a palindrome it will return true and if not will return false. 

To execute the function you need to input a string where the function is called it and it will return true or false while ignoring punctuation, casing, and spaces.
